"""
CISO-ready report builder.

  - build_raw_ciso_report(findings)      -> for the no-harness run
  - build_harness_ciso_report(result)    -> for the Foundry run

The raw report carries an explicit "these findings are unverified" caveat;
the harness report states that every finding carries resolved evidence and
that the run has a coverage claim and a demotion (precision) record.
